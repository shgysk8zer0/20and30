I was once again early for the bi-weekly game night at the [Rook & Rogue](https://www.rookandrogue.com/).
This time, I had purpose in arriving before everybody else, since I wanted to
take some pictures or the place *(it really is kinda fun just looking at the decorations)*
and talking to the staff.

I had been there many times before already and had already seen geeky decorations
like banners for Harry Potter, but that evening I saw a "facehugger" *(those creatures
famous for popping out of someone's chest in Alien)* tucked in the corner by the
vents, which was a very location appropriate for what it is.

This week, there were only 5 RSVPs instead of the usual 8 - 16, and I was looking
forward to spending time in a smaller group. Large groups are great for certain
things, but there are some doors that are only open when there are fewer people.
I had been wanting to play Munchkin, but that's a game that is less than ideal
to teach to multiple people with varied interests. I propped up some cards against
the drink I ordered for a staged photo just before the stated start time of the event.

Munchkin was pulled from the shelves as a mere suggestion for a game for the evening.
Obviously, the choice of game was not entirely up to me, and Rook and Rouge
has no shortage of options. They have games ranging from "Apples to Apples" through...
well, I was going to name a game they have starting with a Z, but I cannot think
of one right now. If you can think of a game, there's a very decent probability
that it's available, though not all are freely available to just anyone. They
have a collection of larger and rare games available with a membership or a day pass.

Instead of Munchkin, we ended up playing Domination. I didn't recognize it at first
because it is one of those games that plays differently and with a different set
of cards depending on how you want to play and how many people are playing. It's
not a very complicated game despite having different options for setup, but it
does involve a decent amount of strategy, and I haven't yet determined what the
best approach is, as shown by my losing again.

There was more conversation and on more interesting subjects this time. We talked
about interesting stories interacting or observing people at our jobs and got to
learn a little background story beyond name, occupation, and place of residence.
I wouldn't go so far as to say that I don't enjoy the excitement that is more
easily seen when there are plenty of people, but it was nice to have any easier time
remembering everyone's name and not having to shout to say something to someone
across a large table when multiple people are talking at once.
