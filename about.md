## Who are we?
[{% include icon.html icon='meetup' width=128 height=128 class='float-left filter-shadow logo' %}](https://www.meetup.com)
We are a [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/20-30-Somethings-Doing-Some-Things/)
primarily active in Bellingham, WA. In theory, our ages range from 20 to 39 years
old, but nobody ever checks.

We do some things. We do indoor things. We do outdoor things. We do things here
or there. We do things everywhere! Well, everywhere roughly near Bellingham at least.

## What do we do?
In short, be **awesome!** This group has a diverse set of interests and activities,
ranging from hiking and game nights at a pub to improv classes and volunteer work.

We are only limited by the imagination of our members *(and boring things like laws
and finances)*, so you're almost sure to find something. If you have something
you'd like to do, feel free to suggest it.

Our most popular event right now is the bi-weekly game night at the [Rook and Rogue](https://www.rookandrogue.com/).

## Can I bring a friend?
Probably. Most events allow bringing guests. You'll have to check first and, if
so, update your RSVP to say how many guests you're bringing.

## Sweet! Where do I sign up
Since all of our events are though Meetup, you'll [need an account](https://secure.meetup.com/register/)
and you'll need to [join our group](https://www.meetup.com/20-30-Somethings-Doing-Some-Things/).
Once you've got the boring stuff out of the way, just RSVP for [some events](https://www.meetup.com/20-30-Somethings-Doing-Some-Things/events/)
and show up when the time comes. Certain events may have an admission cost, but
those should list the cost on the event description.
